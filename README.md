# ccmon — mission control for Claude Code & Codex in tmux

Tracks the live state of every Claude Code / Codex instance running in tmux,
raises **reliable** macOS notifications when one needs you or finishes, and gives
you a TUI to see who needs attention and jump straight to that pane.

## Why

The old setup pushed notifications with an OSC-777 escape wrapped in tmux
passthrough written to `/dev/tty`. That only reaches Ghostty when the pane is
live in the currently-attached client — so notifications from detached/background
sessions were silently dropped (the "flaky push"). ccmon instead talks to
`terminal-notifier` directly, which doesn't care about tmux forwarding, and to
tmux directly for jumping.

## Install

ccmon is macOS-only and needs `tmux` and `terminal-notifier`:

    brew install tmux terminal-notifier

Install the binary, then wire it into Claude Code and Codex:

    go install github.com/jpoz/ccmon@latest   # → ~/go/bin/ccmon (keep ~/go/bin on $PATH)
    ccmon install

`ccmon install` is idempotent — safe to re-run after upgrading or moving the
binary. It:

- adds `ccmon hook` to `~/.claude/settings.json` for every relevant event
  (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Notification, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop,
  SubagentStop, SessionEnd), **preserving any hooks you already have**;
- sets `notify = ["…/ccmon", "codex-hook"]` in `~/.codex/config.toml` — only if
  `~/.codex` exists, and never clobbering a `notify` program you already use;
- backs up each file it touches to `<file>.bak`.

Then **restart any running Claude Code / Codex sessions** so they pick up the
hooks. To verify, undo, or check dependencies:

    ccmon doctor      # report wiring + dependency health
    ccmon uninstall   # remove ccmon's hooks / notify (leaves the rest intact)

Prefer not to use `go install`? Build from source — any dir on your `$PATH`
works, the installer wires whatever path the binary lives at:

    git clone https://github.com/jpoz/ccmon && cd ccmon
    go build -o ~/bin/ccmon .
    ~/bin/ccmon install

## State model

State is detected two ways that back each other up:

**1. Hooks (low-latency, push):**

| state         | set by                                            | notifies |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `idle`        | SessionStart                                      | no       |
| `working`     | UserPromptSubmit / Pre/PostToolUse / SubagentStop | no       |
| `needs-input` | Notification                                      | **yes**  |
| `done`        | Stop / codex turn-complete                        | **yes**  |

`PostToolUse` is the important one: Claude fires **no** event when you *grant*
permission, so a tool actually running again is the signal that you've unblocked
it. Without that hook a session stayed stuck on `needs-input` until the whole
turn ended.

**2. Pane reconciliation (self-healing, pull):** every TUI poll, each Claude
pane is captured (`tmux capture-pane`) and classified directly from what's on
screen — a permission box (`Do you want to proceed?` + `❯ 1. Yes`) ⇒
`needs-input`, a live spinner (`Germinating… (4m 44s · ↓ 18.1k tokens)`) ⇒
`working`, a completed line (`✻ Cooked for 1m 39s` / `※ recap:`) ⇒ `done`. The
pane is ground truth for whether Claude is blocked on you, so this corrects any
hook that was missed, delayed, or never fired. `classifyClaudePane` in `pane.go`
is a pure function; `reconcileClaude` applies it.

State lives in `~/.ccmon/state/<id>.json`, one file per instance.
Each pane is also tagged with a `@cc_state` tmux user option for status bars.

- **Claude** instances report rich state via hooks (keyed by session id), then
  get reconciled against their live pane.
- **Codex** instances report `done` via the `notify` program, and are also
  auto-discovered by scanning tmux even before their first event (state inferred
  from pane activity; shown with a `~` marker).

Instances are pruned automatically when their pane closes.

## Tests

    go test ./...            # unit + tmux integration
    go test -short ./...     # unit only (skips the live-tmux test)

- `pane_test.go` — table-driven classification of real `capture-pane` fixtures
  (working / done / idle / permission / resumed-after-grant).
- `hook_test.go` — the hook state machine, incl. `needs-input → PostToolUse → working`.
- `reconcile_integration_test.go` — paints fixtures into a throwaway tmux pane
  and asserts `reconcileClaude` reads the live pane and corrects stale state.

## Wiring (managed by `ccmon install`)

You don't edit these by hand — `ccmon install` writes them and `ccmon uninstall`
removes them — but for reference, the wiring is:

- `~/.claude/settings.json` → a `hooks` entry calling `ccmon hook` for
  SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Notification, **PreToolUse, PostToolUse,**
  Stop, SubagentStop, and SessionEnd.
- `~/.codex/config.toml` → `notify = ["<path-to>/ccmon", "codex-hook"]`.

## Build

    go build -o ~/bin/ccmon .   # or: go install github.com/jpoz/ccmon@latest

## TUI keys

`↑/↓` or `j/k` move · `Enter` jump to pane · `c` acknowledge (clear alert) ·
`x` forget instance · `f` toggle activity feed · `PgUp/PgDn` (or `Ctrl-U/Ctrl-D`)
scroll the feed · `r` refresh · `q` quit

## Activity feed

`f` toggles a live feed that streams state transitions as they happen —
`working → done`, `idle → needs-input`, a green `+` when a session appears,
`✕ closed` when its pane goes away — each with the project, a relative
timestamp, and the message at the moment it changed. It turns the snapshot into
a story: see what just finished or who went red while you were looking
elsewhere.

The panel is **responsive**: on a wide terminal it docks as a full-height column
to the right of the table; on a narrow one it drops to a strip below it. Either
way the table + feed are centered as a card so nothing smears edge-to-edge.

`PgUp`/`PgDn` (or `Ctrl-U`/`Ctrl-D`) scroll back through history. Scrolling is
**sequence-anchored**, so new events streaming in while you read don't lurch the
view; a `↑N`/`↓N PgDn=live` marker on the panel's title shows how much is off
screen, and scrolling back to the bottom re-engages live-follow.

It's derived purely by diffing successive polls (`recordEvents` in `feed.go`),
so it captures everything the TUI observes — hook-driven changes, pane
reconciliation, codex activity, and your own ack/jump — with no extra hook
wiring. The buffer is in-memory and ephemeral: it shows activity since you
opened the TUI, and seeds silently so already-running sessions don't flood it.

## Re-notifications (nagging)

While the TUI is running it acts as the watcher: any session stuck in
`needs-input` (red) is re-notified every 60s ("⏰ still waiting · Nm") until you
attend to it. Nagging stops the moment the session leaves `needs-input` —
because you jumped to it (`Enter`), acked it (`c`), or it got your input. Each
reminder removes the previous banner first so it reliably re-alerts instead of
silently updating. Only red sessions nag; `done` is informational.

If the TUI isn't running you still get the single initial banner from the hook —
the repeating reminders just need the TUI up (e.g. in a dashboard pane).
